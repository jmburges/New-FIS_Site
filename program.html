<h1>The Program //</h1>
<hr>

<h3>Work in Pairs</h3>
<p>Throughout the program, you'll be learning and working in teams. We're huge 
believers in pairing and basically feel that all work, not just programming, is 
better done in pairs. So get ready to make some new best friends.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Learn to Learn</h3>
<p>Part of being a good programmer is just being able to learn new things 
quickly. In that spirit, you'll be learning lots of new random skills, like 
maybe knot tying, beat-matching and DJ'ing, a little dance, some yoga, and 
whatever else we can come up with. There's a bit of "wax on wax off" going on 
here, so you'll have to trust us that these skills will make you a better coder.
</p>
<hr>

<h3>Build Real Things</h3>
<p>Obviously, the best way to learn is by doing. But there's no point in 
building another sample blog, micro-status, or todo list application. Instead, 
you'll actually be building software that the school will use everyday. That's 
right, we eat our own dogfood. Expect to work on 3-5 projects that will require 
a full-stack of skills and technologies. </p>

<p>While building, you'll go through all the phases of a project: figuring out 
what features to implement, breaking them into small iterations and stories, 
delegating and accepting work, automating a test suite, deploying to the cloud, 
and everything in between. By the end of the semester, you'll be able to point 
to specific commits and features that you had ownership over. What's a better 
resume then that?</p>

<p>You’ll build at least one side-project on your own and at least one, more 
complex project, as part of a team.  To see some examples of what students have 
built so far visit <a

<h4>A few previous projects we're proud of:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="http://viewfinder.io">Viewfinder.io - Week 8 Side Project</a> <br 
      />

      Viewfinder is a game built on the Instagram API. The application pulls in 
      geo-tagged photos from instagram and asks users to guess the location 
      where the photo was taken by dropping a pin on a google map.

    <p>
      <a href="http://built.flatironschool.com">Built @ Flatiron School (Team 
        Project)</a> <br />
      Built@FlatironSchool (a.k.a GitGallery.com) is a CMS designed to store and 
      share galleries of open-source software projects. Designers have awesome 
      resources to visually showcase their work, like Behance and Dribble. While 
      we all love Github, GitGallery allows developers to showcase their 
      projects in a more visually appealing way. When a project is added, 
      GitGallery automatically pulls in all kinds of awesome Github stats, 
      including information on all the contributors, and does some pretty cool 
      analysis on the commits over time.

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.octomaps.com">Octomaps (Week 4 Side Project)</a><br />
      Octomaps is a mapping application designed to show how people from all 
      over the world work together in creating great open-source software.
    </p>

  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="http://built.flatironschool.com/projects/7">HandRaise (Team 
        Project)</a> <br />

      HandRaise is a classroom management tool. It allows students to post their 
      questions online and see what questions other students are asking so they 
      can help out. It also contains a dashboard view (usually projected on 
      screen throughout the day - yep, we actually use it :) so students can see 
      which TA’s are helping whom. TA's also get mobile notifications if for 
      some reason a student isn’t being helped quickly enough.

              <p>Learning is a team sport. As such, we value diversity in 
              background and perspective. We accept about 10% of people who 
              apply into the program. While we could probably admit 30 
              investment bankers who would make awesome developers, that would 
              make for a much less interesting group dynamic. Our student 
              backgrounds have ranged from professional poker players, Major 
              League Baseball scouts and entrepreneurs, designers, lawyers and, 
              yes, investment bankers.</p>

              <p>Our students are smart. Real smart. Sure, we’ve got the Oxford, 
              Harvard, etc. grads. That being said, we see  code as a form of 
              expression and value creativity above all else. Throughout our 
              first two semesters, we realized that over 80% of our students 
              have a background in photography, design, writing, or music. Go 
              figure. Ultimately, students learn more from each other than from 
              lectures. Smart students means great teachers.</p>

              <p>There are lots of great reasons to learn how to code. You can 
              get an awesome job at a sexy tech startup! Or launch an app and be 
              the next Mark Zuckerberg! While those are great goals, if that’s 
              what you’re looking for, this program is not for you. We approach 
              coding as a lifelong craft, rather than a means to an end. Our 
              students are passionate about being great developers and writing 
              code that impacts people. As a recent alum told us in week 7, “I 
              dream in Ruby.”</p>
