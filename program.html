<h1>The Basics //</h1>
<hr>

<h3>Become a Production-Ready Developer</h3>
<p>The Flatiron school is a 12 week, full time, intensive program, designed give you the equivalent skillset and experience of an entry-level Ruby developer. Because we focus heavily on collaboration, you are required to be on campus Monday Thru Friday, 9AM-6PM throughout the duration of the program. There is certainly a fair amount of work to be done beyond those hours (many students choose to stay late and come in on weekends), but that’s the minimum.</p>

<p>Prior to arriving to campus, you’ll also complete 4 weeks (80-120 hours in total) of prework assignments at home. This, plus the following 12 weeks of on-campus learning, amounts to a 16 week commitment.</p>

<p>The cost for the semester is $12,000. However, if you accept a position through our job placement program, we will refund $4,000 of your tuition. Grants and scholarships are also available for students from underrepresented groups like women and minorities.</p>

<h3>We Teach What We Love</h3>
We ♥ Ruby so you'll be spending a lot of time in the Ruby ecosystem. The goal is to make you a full-stack developer, so we'll also teach you the other required technologies, buzz-words, and acronyms.  <a href="curriculum.html">Check out the full curriculum</a>.

<h1>The Program //</h1>
<hr>

<h3>Work in Pairs</h3>
<p>Throughout the 12 week program, you'll be learning and working in teams. We're huge believers in pairing and basically feel that all work, not just programming, is better done in pairs. So get ready to make some new best friends.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Learn to Learn</h3>
<p>Part of being a good programmer is just being able to learn new things quickly. In that spirit, you'll be learning lots of new random skills, like maybe knot tying, beat-matching and DJ'ing, a little dance, some yoga, and whatever else we can come up with. There's a bit of "wax on wax off" going on here, so you'll have to trust us that these skills will make you a better coder.
</p>
<hr>

<h3>Build Real Things</h3>
<p>Obviously, the best way to learn is by doing. But there's no point in building another sample blog, micro-status, or todo list application. Instead, you'll actually be building software that the school will use everyday. That's right, we eat our own dogfood. Expect to work on 3-5 projects that will require a full-stack of skills and technologies. </p>

<p>While building, you'll go through all the phases of a project: figuring out what features to implement, breaking them into small iterations and stories, delegating and accepting work, automating a test suite, deploying to the cloud, and everything in between. By the end of the semester, you'll be able to point to specific commits and features that you had ownership over. What's a better resume then that?</p>

<p>You’ll build at least one side-project on your own and at least one, more complex project, as part of a team.  To see some examples of what students have built so far visit <a href="http://built.flatironschool.com">built.flatironschool.com</a></p>

<h4>A few previous projects we're proud of:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="http://viewfinder.io">Viewfinder.io - Week 8 Side Project</a> <br />

      Viewfinder is a game built on the Instagram API. The application pulls in geo-tagged photos from instagram and asks users to guess the location where the photo was taken by dropping a pin on a google map.

    <p>
      <a href="http://built.flatironschool.com">Built @ Flatiron School (Team Project)</a> <br />
      Built@FlatironSchool (a.k.a GitGallery.com) is a CMS designed to store and share galleries of open-source software projects. Designers have awesome resources to visually showcase their work, like Behance and Dribble. While we all love Github, GitGallery allows developers to showcase their projects in a more visually appealing way. When a project is added, GitGallery automatically pulls in all kinds of awesome Github stats, including information on all the contributors, and does some pretty cool analysis on the commits over time.

  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.octomaps.com">Octomaps (Week 4 Side Project)</a><br />
      Octomaps is a mapping application designed to show how people from all over the world work together in creating great open-source software.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="http://built.flatironschool.com/projects/7">HandRaise (Team Project)</a> <br />

      HandRaise is a classroom management tool. It allows students to post their questions online and see what questions other students are asking so they can help out. It also contains a dashboard view (usually projected on screen throughout the day - yep, we actually use it :) so students can see which TA’s are helping whom. TA's also get mobile notifications if for some reason a student isn’t being helped quickly enough.

<h3>Prework: Fundamentals</h3>

<p>Before arriving on campus all students complete 100+ hours of <a href="http://prework.flatironschool.com">prework online</a>. During this phase we go for breadth over depth. The goal is to familiarize you with some basic concepts and get everyone to a minimum baseline so that we can hit the ground running on campus.</p>

We also dedicate time to focus on on-boarding and test-driven development. Students switch projects, learn to read each others’ code, write test coverage, and add features. Break things and fix them :)</p>

              <p>Our students are smart. Real smart. Sure, we’ve got the Oxford, Harvard, etc. grads. That being said, we see  code as a form of expression and value creativity above all else. Throughout our first two semesters, we realized that over 80% of our students have a background in photography, design, writing, or music. Go figure. Ultimately, students learn more from each other than from lectures. Smart students means great teachers.</p>

While those are great goals, if that’s what you’re looking for, this program is not for you. We approach coding as a lifelong craft, rather than a means to an end. Our students are passionate about being great developers and writing code that impacts people. As a recent alum told us in week 7, “I dream in Ruby.”</p>
