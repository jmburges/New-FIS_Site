<p>New York City is proud to launch the new NYC Web Development Fellowship, designed to help New Yorkers with little to no web development experience get the training necessary to secure jobs as Web Developers. Offered by the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/sbs" target="_blank">NYC Department of Small Business Services</a>, the initiative was announced by Mayor Bloomberg in the State of the City address in February, and will support the growing number of tech companies in the City.</p>

<p>This Fellowship will allow New Yorkers to attend the Flatiron School at no-cost – a program that normally charges students $12,000.  Applicants must be eligible and go through a competitive screening process. Applicants must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be at least 18 years of age</li>
  <li>Live in New York City</li>
  <li>Have never been employed (full-time or part-time) as a web developer</li>
  <li>Be unemployed; or if employed, they must have an annual income of no more than $50,000</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.sss.gov/default.htm" target="_blank">Meet all federal selective service requirements</a>, if applicable</li>
</ul>

<h1>Basics //</h1>
<hr>

<h3>Become a production ready-developer</h3>
<p>The NYC Web Development Fellowship is a 22-week, full time, intensive program, designed to give New Yorkers with little to no prior experience the equivalent skillset and experience of an entry-level Ruby developer.</p>
<p>During the first 4 weeks of the program, you will complete 80-120 hours of prework assignments at home or on campus. This, plus the following 18 weeks of on-campus learning, amounts to a 22 week commitment. During the on-campus portion of the program, students will be expected to commit full time and be present Monday through Friday, 9AM-6PM (there will be additional homework beyond those hours).</p>
<p>The price of this program is normally $12,000, but thanks to funding from NYC Department of Small Business Services, this program is now available at no cost. Because of this, we ask that all applicants be serious about the full 22-week time commitment.</p>

<h3>We Teach What We Love</h3>
We ♥ Ruby so you'll be spending a lot of time in the Ruby ecosystem. The goal is to make you a full-stack developer, so we'll also teach you the other required technologies, buzz-words, and acronyms.  

<br/><br/>

<h1>Programs //</h1>
<hr>

<h3>Work in Pairs</h3>
<p>Throughout the your time here, you'll be learning and working in teams. We're huge 
believers in pairing and basically feel that all work, not just programming, is 
better done in pairs. So get ready to make some new best friends.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Learn to Learn</h3>
<p>Part of being a good programmer is just being able to learn new things 
quickly. In that spirit, you'll be learning lots of new random skills, like 
maybe knot tying, beat-matching and DJ'ing, a little dance, some yoga, and 
whatever else we can come up with. There's a bit of "wax on wax off" going on 
here, so you'll have to trust us that these skills will make you a better coder.
</p>
<hr>

<h3>Build Real Things</h3>
<p>Obviously, the best way to learn is by doing. But there's no point in 
building another sample blog, micro-status, or todo list application. Instead, 
you'll actually be building software that the school will use everyday. That's 
right, we eat our own dogfood. Expect to work on projects that will require 
a full-stack of skills and technologies. </p>

<p>While building, you'll go through all the phases of a project: figuring out 
what features to implement, breaking them into small iterations and stories, 
delegating and accepting work, automating a test suite, deploying to production, 
and everything in between. By the end of the semester, you'll be able to point 
to specific commits and features that you had ownership over. What's a better 
resume then that?</p>

<p>You’ll build at least one side-project on your own and at least one, more 
complex project, as part of a team.  To see some examples of what students have 
built so far visit <a

<h4>A few previous projects we're proud of:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="http://viewfinder.io">Viewfinder.io - Ruby Week 8 Side Project</a> <br 
      />

      Viewfinder is a game built on the Instagram API. The application pulls in 
      geo-tagged photos from instagram and asks users to guess the location 
      where the photo was taken by dropping a pin on a google map.

    <p>
      <a href="http://built.flatironschool.com">Built @ Flatiron School (Ruby Team 
        Project)</a> <br />
      Built@FlatironSchool (a.k.a GitGallery.com) is a CMS designed to store and 
      share galleries of open-source software projects. Designers have awesome 
      resources to visually showcase their work, like Behance and Dribble. While 
      we all love Github, GitGallery allows developers to showcase their 
      projects in a more visually appealing way. When a project is added, 
      GitGallery automatically pulls in all kinds of awesome Github stats, 
      including information on all the contributors, and does some pretty cool 
      analysis on the commits over time.

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.octomaps.com">Octomaps (Ruby Week 4 Side Project)</a><br />
      Octomaps is a mapping application designed to show how people from all 
      over the world work together in creating great open-source software.

  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="http://built.flatironschool.com/projects/7">HandRaise (Team 
        Project)</a> <br />

      HandRaise is a classroom management tool. It allows students to post their 
      questions online and see what questions other students are asking so they 
      can help out. It also contains a dashboard view (usually projected on 
      screen throughout the day - yep, we actually use it :) so students can see 
      which TA’s are helping whom. TA's also get mobile notifications if for 
      some reason a student isn’t being helped quickly enough.

During this portion of the program, students are not required to work on campus, though they will have the option to do so and full access to instructors to help guide them through the work. The prework curriculum is outlined at <a href="http://prework.flatironschool.com" target="_blank">http://prework.flatironschool.com</a> (currently used by over 2,500 people/month).</p>

              have a background in photography, design, writing, or music. Go 
              figure. Ultimately, students learn more from each other than from 
              lectures. Smart students means great teachers.</p>

              <p>There are lots of great reasons to learn how to code. You can 
              get an awesome job at a sexy tech startup! Or launch an app and be 
              the next Mark Zuckerberg! While those are great goals, if that’s 
              what you’re looking for, this program is not for you. We approach 
              coding as a lifelong craft, rather than a means to an end. Our 
              students are passionate about being great developers and writing 
              code that impacts people. As a recent Ruby alum told us in week 7, “I 
              dream in Ruby.”</p>

          <h4>Instructor</h4>
          <p>I like to think about thinking, especially the type of thinking that happens when people write code.</p>
          <p>When I was in college at Wesleyan University, people called me <a href="http://wesleyanargus.com/2006/12/01/wesceleb-ashley-williams-%E2%80%9908/" target="_blank">The Server"</a>. As a freshman I had inherited a dubiously-legal cardboard box held together with beer wrappers that ran some homespun instances of dc++, bang with friends, and an anonymous confession board. It was clearly the beginning of something beautiful.</p>
          <p>Since those days of trolling campus network bandwidth, I've had a pretty varied experience. A former NYC teaching fellow, I've lingered somewhere on the vast spectrum formed by the intersection of education and technology; along the way, I taught myself to be a web developer.</p>
          <p>Nowadays I evangelize open source, and actively work on transparent government and civic technology initiatives through my role as dev captain and co-organize of the <a href="http://brigade.codeforameria.org/" target="_blank">NYC Code for America</a> brigade, #betaNYC. For fun I'm a member of a band called CSV soundsystem that makes music with open data, and regularly cause trouble in the "philosophy in the time of software" google group. Also, I really like jokes.</p>

          <h4>Instructor</h4>
          <p>After spending four freezing year in New Hampshire for college, I took to Hawaii where I was determined to learn 1) how to surf and 2) how to live the good life. After realizing I wasn't satisfied in paradise, I took the red pill and moved to NYC. I spent a few years building complicated Excel applications for hedge funds, traveled the world, and eventually found my calling: worshipping at the church of DHH.</p>
          <p>I spent a summer locked in my apartment working with a few friends to build my first Rails app, and then learned that Ruby and Rails were different things. I took a job as a Junior Developer at <a href="http://nyc.lifebooker.com/welcome" target="_blank">Lifebooker.com</a> and learned enormous amount, but wanted to get even closer to the metal. I left Lifebooker to learn and teach at Hacker School, and spent three months studying concurrency, learning C, and polishing my Javascript chops. I joined Flatiron School in March of 2013.</p>
          <p>If I'm not coding, you'll probably find me shredding waves on a beach somewhere tropical. But I always come back really missing SublimeText.</p>
