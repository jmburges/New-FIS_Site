<p>New York City is proud to launch the new NYC Web Development Fellowship, designed to train Fellows with the skills necessary to start a career in web development. Graduates from the Fellowship will be qualified to for jobs as Web Developers, creating web-based software applications that power internet services like Twitter, Tribeca Film Festival and The New York Times.</p>
<p>Offered by the Workforce Development Corporation, a not-for-profit affiliated with the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/sbs" target="_blank">NYC Department of Small Business Services</a>, this initiative was announced by Mayor Bloomberg in the State of the City address in February. It will support the growing number of tech companies in the City, especially in Downtown Brooklyn where the Fellowship’s campus will be.</p>
<p>This Fellowship will allow New Yorkers to get training from <a href="http://www.flatironschool.com" target="_blank">The Flatiron School</a> at no-cost – a program that normally charges students $12,000. Only 28 students will be selected. Applicants must be eligible and go through a competitive screening process.</p>

<h4>Applicants must:</h4>
<ul class="requirements">
  <li>Be at least 18 years of age</li>
  <li>Live in New York City</li>
  <li>Have never been employed (full-time or part-time) as a web developer</li>
  <li>Currently earn less than $50,000 per year or be unemployed</li>
  <li>Meet all <a href="http://www.sss.gov/default.htm" target="_blank">federal selective service requirements</a>, where applicable</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>All admitted fellows must be committed to doing 150+ hours of prework and being on campus from 9:00AM to 6:00PM, Monday thru Friday, starting in October, 2013 through February, 2014 (dates subject to change). Admissions are done on a rolling basis, so the earlier you apply, the better.
Have questions about Eligibility? See our <a href="/doc/Web_Developer_FAQ4.pdf" target="_blank">Frequently Asked Questions</a> for answers, or contact <a href="mailto:nycworkforce1@flatironschool.com" target="_blank">nycworkforce1@flatironschool.com</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>Deadline to apply is Wednesday, September 18th at 11:59PM EDT.</p>

<h1>Basics //</h1>
<hr>

<h3>Become a production ready-developer</h3>
<p>The NYC Web Development Fellowship is a 22-week, full time, intensive program, designed give New Yorkers with no prior experience the skills and experience needed to be hired as entry-level Ruby developers.</p> 
<p>The Fellowship is adapted from an existing program from the Flatiron School that has shown much success in training people in the skills they need to get jobs as web developers. To see more information about where previous graduates of the Flatiron School have been hired as engineers, <a href="http://flatironschool.com/employers.html" target="_blank">click here.</a> </p>
<p>Because the program focuses heavily on collaboration, Fellows are required to be on campus Monday through Friday, 9:00AM-6:00PM throughout the duration of the program. There will be additional work beyond those hours that can be done from home, though many Fellows will choose to stay late and come in on weekends.</p>
<p>During the first 4 weeks of the 22-week program, you will complete 150+ hours of prework assignments at home or on campus. This, plus the following 18 weeks of on-campus learning, adds up to a 22-week commitment.</p>
<p>The cost of this program is normally $12,000, but now, the NYC Web Development Fellowship offers this program at no cost. Because of this, all applicants must be serious about the full 22-week time commitment.

<h3>Work in Pairs</h3>
<p>All Fellows will be learning and working in teams throughout the fellowship. We put a strong emphasis on teamwork in order to foster a real-world work environment.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Learn to Learn</h3>
<p>Technology is always changing, so part of being a great developer is being comfortable being a beginner and learning new things. We will spend a significant amount of time learning new and varied skills, and developing your ability to learn.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Build Real Things</h3>
<p>The best way to learn is by doing – but there is no point in building another sample blog, micro-status, or to-do list application. Instead, you will be building software that the school will use every day. Expect to work on projects that will require a full-stack of skills and technologies.</p>

<p>While building, you will go through all the phases of a project figuring out what features to implement, breaking them into small iterations and stories, delegating and accepting work, automating a test suite, deploying to production, and more.</p>

<p>By the end of the Fellowship, you will have built at least one project on your own and at least one, more complex project as part of a team. To see examples of what previous students of The Flatiron School have built, visit <a href="http://built.flatironschool.com" target="_blank">built.flatironschool.com</a></p>

<h4>A few examples of projects built by graduates of The Flatiron School:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="http://viewfinder.io" target="_blank">Viewfinder.io - Ruby Week 8 Side Project</a> <br 
      />

      Viewfinder is a game built on the Instagram API. The application pulls in 
      geo-tagged photos from instagram and asks users to guess the location 
      where the photo was taken by dropping a pin on a google map.

  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="http://built.flatironschool.com" target="_blank">Built @ Flatiron School (Ruby Team 
        Project)</a> <br />
      Built@FlatironSchool (a.k.a GitGallery.com) is a CMS designed to store and 
      share galleries of open-source software projects. Designers have awesome 
      resources to visually showcase their work, like Behance and Dribble. While 
      we all love Github, GitGallery allows developers to showcase their 
      projects in a more visually appealing way. When a project is added, 
      GitGallery automatically pulls in all kinds of awesome Github stats, 
      including information on all the contributors, and does some pretty cool 
      analysis on the commits over time.

  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.octomaps.com" target="_blank">Octomaps (Ruby Week 4 Side Project)</a><br />
      Octomaps is a mapping application designed to show how people from all 
      over the world work together in creating great open-source software.

  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="http://built.flatironschool.com/projects/7" target="_blank">HandRaise (Team 
        Project)</a> <br />

      HandRaise is a classroom management tool. It allows students to post their 
      questions online and see what questions other students are asking so they 
      can help out. It also contains a dashboard view (usually projected on 
      screen throughout the day - yep, we actually use it :) so students can see 
      which TA’s are helping whom. TA's also get mobile notifications if for 
      some reason a student isn’t being helped quickly enough.

              <p>Learning is a team sport. As such, we value diversity in 
              background and perspective. We expect to admit about 10% of people who 
              apply into the fellowship and think that diversity makes for the best learning environment. Our student 
              backgrounds have includeded professional poker players, Major 
              League Baseball players, entrepreneurs, artists, writers, designers, lawyers, investment bankers, and more.</p>

              <p>Our students are smart. That being said, we see  code as a form of 
              expression and value creativity above all else. Over 80% of previous Flatiron School graduates have had backgrounds in photography, design, writing, or music. Ultimately, students learn more from each other than from lectures. Smart students means great teachers.</p>

              <p>There are lots of great reasons to learn how to code. You can 
              get a great job at a tech startup! Or launch an app and be the next Mark Zuckerberg! While those are great goals, if that’s what you’re looking for, this Fellowship is not for you. Flatiron School approaches coding as a lifelong craft, rather than a means to an end. Fellows must be passionate about being great developers and writing code that impacts people.</p>

          <h4>Instructor</h4>
          <p>I like to think about thinking, especially the type of thinking that happens when people write code.</p>
          <p>When I was in college at Wesleyan University, people called me <a href="http://wesleyanargus.com/2006/12/01/wesceleb-ashley-williams-%E2%80%9908/" target="_blank">"The Network"</a>. As a freshman I had inherited a dubiously-legal cardboard box held together with beer wrappers that ran some homespun instances of dc++, bang with friends, and an anonymous confession board. It was clearly the beginning of something beautiful.</p>
          <p>Since those days of trolling campus network bandwidth, I've had a pretty varied experience. A former <a href="https://www.nycteachingfellows.org/Default.asp">NYC Teaching Fellow</a>, I've lingered somewhere on the vast spectrum formed by the intersection of education and technology; along the way, I taught myself to be a web developer.</p>
          <p>Nowadays I evangelize open source: maintaining the <a href="https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra-recipes">sinatra-recipes project</a>, while also contributing to several others. I also actively work on transparent government and civic technology initiatives through my role as dev captain and co-organizer of the <a href="http://brigade.codeforameria.org/" target="_blank">NYC Code for America</a> brigade, #betaNYC.</p>

          <h4>Instructor</h4>
          <p>After spending four freezing year in New Hampshire for college, I took to Hawaii where I was determined to learn 1) how to surf and 2) how to live the good life. After realizing I wasn't satisfied in paradise, I took the red pill and moved to NYC. I spent a few years building complicated Excel applications for hedge funds, traveled the world, and eventually found my calling: worshipping at the church of DHH.</p>
          <p>I spent a summer locked in my apartment working with a few friends to build my first Rails app, and then learned that Ruby and Rails were different things. I took a job as a Junior Developer at <a href="http://nyc.lifebooker.com/welcome" target="_blank">Lifebooker.com</a> and learned an enormous amount, but wanted to get even closer to the metal. I left Lifebooker to learn and teach at Hacker School, and spent three months studying concurrency, learning C, and polishing my Javascript chops. I joined Flatiron School in March of 2013.</p>
          <p>If I'm not coding, you'll probably find me shredding waves on a beach somewhere tropical. But I always come back really missing SublimeText.</p>
