    <h2>Become a Flatiron Mentor</h2>
    <h3>"The manatee has become the mento." Tracy Jordan</h3>

    <p>
      In an effort to further our students engagement with the community and prepare them for a career in code, we're starting a mentoring program. Being a mentor is part of being a programmer. It helps you articulate and solidify your knowledge of code, clarify thinking about your career, expand your professional network, and provides valuable leadership skills. It also does all that for your mentee too, so it's an extremely valuable program.

      </ol>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      All told, we think a mentor would spend 15-20 hours with the student over the course of the semester. Additionally, we ask that mentors agree, internalize, and practice our <a href="/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The Flatiron School mentorship is going to be an amazing experience and we see it as a way for you to give back to the community by ushering in a new generation of passionate and diverse programmers. Mentor the change in the community you want to see. Plus, we're going to throw all the mentors a big party at the end.
