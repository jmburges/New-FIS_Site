    <h2>Become a Flatiron Mentor</h2>
    <h3>"The manatee has become the mento." Tracy Jordan</h3>
  </div>
  
  <div class="content-full">
    <p>
      In an effort to further our students engagement with the community and prepare them for a career in code, we're starting a mentoring program. Being a mentor is part of being a programmer. It helps you articulate and solidify your knowledge of code, clarify thinking about your career, expand your professional network, and provides valuable leadership skills. It also does all that for your mentee too, so it's an extremely valuable program.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Responsibilities</strong>

      <ol>
        <li>Having a lunch (on us of course) with an eager beginner developer.</li>
        <li>Come watch them present at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nyc-on-rails/">NYC on Rails</a> once a semester.</li>
        <li>Take them to a technical meetup like <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-rb/">NYC.Rb</a> or <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-RubyMotion/">RubyMotion NYC</a></li>
        <li>One pairing session (2-4 hours) on one of their projects.</li>
        <li>Answer the occasional email they might send :-)</li>
        <li>Bring them to work for a day and let them shadow you, heck, maybe even pair.</li>
        <li>Provide meaningful career guidance, such as recommending great books, screencasts, or blog posts to reads, suggesting favorite conferences, meet ups, events, and hackathons to attend, and inspiring them with stories of your projects, code, and career. Be a guide.</li>
        <li>Write a blog post about the experience. </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      All told, we think a mentor would spend 15-20 hours with the student over the course of the semester. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>What's it take to be a Flatiron Mentor?</strong>

      <ul>
        <li>6-9 months of professional experience as a developer should do (You don't need to be a Rubyist).</li>
        <li>You are available to make the time commitment.</li>
        <li>You are a sensitive, patience, and empathic person.</li>
      <ul>

      That's basically it. This is our first go of this and if you're excited, we're excited about having you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, we ask that mentors agree, internalize, and practice our <a href="/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The Flatiron School mentorship is going to be an amazing experience and we see it as a way for you to give back to the community by ushering in a new generation of passionate and diverse programmers. Mentor the change in the community you want to see. Plus, we're going to throw all the mentors a big party at the end.
