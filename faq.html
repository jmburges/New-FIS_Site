        <blockquote>
          <p><span class="highlight">Is this really full time?</span> Yep. Learning to be a web developer in 12 weeks is ambitious, yet achievable. Don't plan on pursuing any new hobbies.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><span class="highlight">Do I need any experience to apply?</span> Nope. We're just looking for great people with a strong desire to learn. We do want to hit the ground running on Day 1 so we assign you 80-100 hours of pre-work to go through before class starts.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><span class="highlight">Why shouldn't I just learn to code online?</span> We love online resources! They're great learning resources and can give you a great foundation. But there's a lot more to being a productive web developer than learning a specific language (see "what graduates grok"), and that's what we want to focus on.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><span class="highlight">Why Ruby?</span> The language you learn matters least. Programming is about abstractions and expressions: the mechanics of code are universal and exist in all modern languages, whether it's Python, Ruby, or Javascript. We teach Ruby because we love it. Thinking that your choice of language matters — especially as a beginner — is like thinking that you can only write poetry in English. The beauty of poetry is in rhyme and meter, in metaphor and simile, in cadence and rhythm, not in the King's English. We teach Ruby and the Ruby ecosystem (which includes Rails) but you're really learning how to think, how to break problems down, how to express yourself, how to abstract ideas, and how to work together. We just do that through Ruby.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><span class="highlight">Do I need a computer?</span> We work on Macs with minimum specs. If you don't have one already, we can provide a loaner.</p>
