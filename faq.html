          <p><span class="highlight">What makes The Flatiron School unique?</span> Good question. Ultimately, it comes down to 6 things. Teacher Quality, Logistics, Culture, Focus, Learning Philosophy and Teaching Philosophy. For a much more detailed explanation, check out <a href="http://qr.ae/p7yol">this quora post</a> by our Dean, Avi.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><span class="highlight">How much does the program cost?</span> Tuition is $12,000. However, you will receive a $4,000 refund if you accept a position through our jobs placement program. We work with some of the best Ruby shops in the country to give you amazing opportunities. We also have grants and scholarships available for students from underrepresented groups like females and minorities.</p>

          <p><span class="highlight">Is this really full time?</span> Yep. Learning to be a web developer in 12 weeks is ambitious, yet achievable. Don't plan on pursuing any new hobbies.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><span class="highlight">Do I need any experience to apply?</span> Nope. We're just looking for great people with a strong desire to learn. Our students have ranged from having zero background to having 3 years of experience as a .NET developer who wanted to learn Ruby. The biggest common thread among our students is that each one has a genuine desire to be a great developers. So before you apply, make sure this is something you know you want to do. Try some tutorial. Read some books. Pair with a friend. If you’re 100% committed, nothing will get in your way.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><span class="highlight">Why shouldn't I just learn to code online?</span> We love online resources! They're great for getting started and can give you a solid foundation. But there's a lot more to being a productive web developer than learning a specific language, from working in teams, to becoming part of the developer community, and that's what we want to focus on. As we like to say, you can get pretty good at guitar teaching yourself at home, but if you want to be part of a band, you need to play with people.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><span class="highlight">Why Ruby?</span> The language you learn matters least. Programming is about abstractions and expressions: the mechanics of code are universal and exist in all modern languages. We teach Ruby because we love it. Thinking that your choice of language matters — especially as a beginner — is like thinking that you can only write poetry in English. The beauty of poetry is in rhyme and meter, in metaphor and simile, in cadence and rhythm, not in the King's English. We teach Ruby and the Ruby ecosystem (which includes Rails) but you're really learning how to think, how to break problems down, how to express yourself, how to abstract ideas, and how to work together. We just do that through Ruby.</p>

          <p><span class="highlight">Do I need a computer?</span> We work on Macs with minimum specs. If you don't have one already, we can provide a loaner.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><span class="highlight">When should I apply?</span> Admissions for all programs are being done on a rolling basis, so the earlier you apply, the better.</p>
