<h3>Become a Production-Ready Developer</h3>
<p>The Ruby program is a 12 week, full time, intensive program, designed give you the equivalent skillset and experience of an entry-level Ruby developer. Because we focus heavily on collaboration, you are required to be on campus Monday Thru Friday, 9AM-6PM throughout the duration of the program. There is certainly a fair amount of work to be done beyond those hours (many students choose to stay late and come in on weekends), but that’s the minimum.</p>

<p>Prior to arriving to campus, you’ll also complete 4 weeks (80-120 hours in total) of prework assignments at home. This, plus the following 12 weeks of on-campus learning, amounts to a 16 week commitment.</p>

<p>The cost for the semester is $12,000. However, if you accept a position through our job placement program, we will refund $4,000 of your tuition. Grants and scholarships are also available for students from underrepresented groups like women and minorities.</p>
<hr>

<h3>We Teach What We Love</h3>
We ♥ Ruby so you'll be spending a lot of time in the Ruby ecosystem. The goal is to make you a full-stack developer, so we'll also teach you the other required technologies, buzz-words, and acronyms.  

<br/><br/>

<h1>Program //</h1>

<h3>Work in Pairs</h3>
<p>Throughout the your time here, you'll be learning and working in teams. We're huge 
believers in pairing and basically feel that all work, not just programming, is 
better done in pairs. So get ready to make some new best friends.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Learn to Learn</h3>
<p>Part of being a good programmer is just being able to learn new things 
quickly. In that spirit, you'll be learning lots of new random skills, like 
maybe knot tying, beat-matching and DJ'ing, a little dance, some yoga, and 
whatever else we can come up with. There's a bit of "wax on wax off" going on 
here, so you'll have to trust us that these skills will make you a better coder.
</p>
<hr>

<h3>Build Real Things</h3>
<p>Obviously, the best way to learn is by doing. But there's no point in 
building another sample blog, micro-status, or todo list application. Instead, 
you'll actually be building software that the school will use everyday. That's 
right, we eat our own dogfood. Expect to work on projects that will require 
a full-stack of skills and technologies. </p>

<p>While building, you'll go through all the phases of a project: figuring out 
what features to implement, breaking them into small iterations and stories, 
delegating and accepting work, automating a test suite, deploying to production, 
and everything in between. By the end of the semester, you'll be able to point 
to specific commits and features that you had ownership over. What's a better 
resume then that?</p>

<p>You’ll build at least one side-project on your own and at least one, more 
complex project, as part of a team.  To see some examples of what students have 
built so far visit <a

<h4>A few previous projects we're proud of:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="http://viewfinder.io">Viewfinder.io - Ruby Week 8 Side Project</a> <br 
      />

      Viewfinder is a game built on the Instagram API. The application pulls in 
      geo-tagged photos from instagram and asks users to guess the location 
      where the photo was taken by dropping a pin on a google map.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="http://built.flatironschool.com">Built @ Flatiron School (Ruby Team 
        Project)</a> <br />
      Built@FlatironSchool (a.k.a GitGallery.com) is a CMS designed to store and 
      share galleries of open-source software projects. Designers have awesome 
      resources to visually showcase their work, like Behance and Dribble. While 
      we all love Github, GitGallery allows developers to showcase their 
      projects in a more visually appealing way. When a project is added, 
      GitGallery automatically pulls in all kinds of awesome Github stats, 
      including information on all the contributors, and does some pretty cool 
      analysis on the commits over time.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.octomaps.com">Octomaps (Ruby Week 4 Side Project)</a><br />
      Octomaps is a mapping application designed to show how people from all 
      over the world work together in creating great open-source software.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="http://built.flatironschool.com/projects/7">HandRaise (Team 
        Project)</a> <br />

      HandRaise is a classroom management tool. It allows students to post their 
      questions online and see what questions other students are asking so they 
      can help out. It also contains a dashboard view (usually projected on 
      screen throughout the day - yep, we actually use it :) so students can see 
      which TA’s are helping whom. TA's also get mobile notifications if for 
      some reason a student isn’t being helped quickly enough.
    </p>

</ul>

<h3>Prework: Fundamentals</h3>

<p>Before arriving on campus all students complete 100+ hours of <a href="http://prework.flatironschool.com">prework online</a>. During this phase we go for breadth over depth. The goal is to familiarize you with some basic concepts and get everyone to a minimum baseline so that we can hit the ground running on campus.</p>

We also dedicate time to focus on on-boarding and test-driven development. Students switch projects, learn to read each others’ code, write test coverage, and add features. Break things and fix them :)</p>
