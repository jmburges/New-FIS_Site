    <p>The Flatiron School believes our community should be open for everyone. We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, preferred operating system, programming language, or text editor.</p>

    <p>We expect all faculty, teachers, employees, mentors, students, guests, friends, basically everyone involved with the school, to help us create a safe and positive environment for everyone. Let's build a place where we can achieve more together than we could ever achieve alone.</p>

    <p>We expect everyone to:
      <ul>
        <li>Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.</li>
        <li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.</li>
        <li>Create a positive impact on everything around them.</li>
        <li>Participate in an authentic and active way.</li>
        <li>Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>We think that everyone is born with a little voice inside them. That little voice goes off whenever they are about to do or say something stupid. Most of the time, we don't listen to it. Start listening to that little voice. If you think you are about to do something that has the potential, even the very slightest potential, of offending or hurting someone, just don't do it. It is that simple. But if you need a more explicit list:</p>

    <p>
      <quote>Unacceptable behaviors include harassing, abusive, discriminatory, or derogatory conduct. Harassment includes: offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of sexual images; deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</quote>
