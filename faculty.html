      <h3><span class="highlight">Avi Flombaum, Dean</span></h3>
      <p>Someday in 1995, I dialed into the internet for the first time. Though I was only 12, I instantly knew that the web was my future. Immediately, I started teaching myself to program and have not stopped since. My career began at 16 when I worked for an NYC startup, cityfeet.com. At 20, I was the CTO of a hedgefund. Then I started a site called designerpages.com. I also organize one of the largest Rails meetups in the world, NYC on Rails.</p>
      <p>Over the past few years, <a href="http://www.skillshare.com/profile/Avi-Flombaum/8160601/endorsements" target="_blank">I've taught Ruby to over 300 people</a>. I really love sharing my passion for code with people and can't wait to learn with you.</p>

      <h3><span class="highlight">Adam Enbar, President</span></h3>
      <p>While researching innovations in higher education at Charles River Ventures, I quickly learned that even with record unemployment, companies are having more trouble than ever finding the skilled talent that they need to fill key roles. That's a problem worth fixing.</p>
      <p>Before joining CRV I worked at HubSpot running the National Accounts team. During that time, I taught Entrepreneurship 101 at South Bay Correctional Facility, and lectured on Inbound Marketing at Harvard Business School, where I started the Sales Club to teach MBA's how to sell. I'm excited to be helping a new generation of doers acquire the skills they need to put a dent in the universe.</p>

      <h3><span class="highlight">Joe Burgess, Teacher</span></h3>
      <p>I initially connected to the internet on my Dad's 
      <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_6200">Power Macintosh 6200</a>
      and was instantly hooked on the different ways I could waste time online.
      Slowly over time I got bored with consuming, and started teaching myself 
      how to create. </p>
      
      <p>While at college at Carnegie Mellon University I started helping others create
      by being a Teacher's Assistant for 3 of my 4 years there. By senior year, I 
      helped create an iPhone app for the Pittsburgh Post Gazette that crowdsourced
      public bus data and went on to work with faculty to develop an iOS class 
      to be taught at CMU. After a brief stint at IBM, I've returned to 
      what I really love and am looking forward to teaching and learning from you.</p>

      <h3><span class="highlight">Jeffrey Baird, TA</span></h3>
      <p>Most of my post-high school education was focused on becoming a merchant mariner. When I decided that a pirate's life was *not* for me, I started a tech company in Tampa called Kngroo. While developing the company, I started picking up a little Ruby. It wasn't long before I was completely obsessed.</p>

      <p>I shut down Kngroo shortly after and started teaching myself to code full-time. A little over a year ago, I got my first Ruby gig working for Medivo, a start-up in Manhattan. Not long after that, Avi asked me to come help students replicate my success.</p>

      <p>When I'm not "hitting the keys," I bike, run, read and travel. I am a karaoke fiend and a coffee enthusiast. If you need to pick my brain about anything, I find it hard to say no to a good IPA.</p>
