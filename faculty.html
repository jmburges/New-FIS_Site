          <h4>Dean</h4>
          <p>Someday in 1995, I dialed into the internet for the first time. Though I was only 12, I instantly knew that the web was my future. Immediately, I started teaching myself to program and have not stopped since. My career began at 16 when I worked for an NYC startup, cityfeet.com. At 20, I was the CTO of a hedgefund. Then I started a site called designerpages.com. I also organize one of the largest Rails meetups in the world, NYC on Rails.</p>
          <p>Over the past few years, <a href="http://www.skillshare.com/profile/Avi-Flombaum/8160601/endorsements" target="_blank">I've taught Ruby to over 300 people</a>. I really love sharing my passion for code with people and can't wait to learn with you.</p>

          <h4>President</h4>
          <p>While researching innovations in higher education at Charles River Ventures, I quickly learned that even with record unemployment, companies are having more trouble than ever finding the skilled talent that they need to fill key roles. That's a problem worth fixing.</p>
          <p>Before joining CRV I worked at HubSpot running the National Accounts team. During that time, I taught Entrepreneurship 101 at South Bay Correctional Facility, and lectured on Inbound Marketing at Harvard Business School, where I started the Sales Club to teach MBA's how to sell. I'm excited to be helping a new generation of doers acquire the skills they need to put a dent in the universe.</p>

          <p>In 1996, I used Logo and a turquoise iMac to make a turtle draw circles and squares.</p>
          <p>Not-so-shortly thereafter, I joined a New York startup, SHEfinds Media, to head up content sales and marketing, then another, H.Bloom, where I was Director of Talent through May 2013.</p>

          <h3>Ashley Williams</h3>
          <h4>Instructor</h4>
          <p>I like to think about thinking, especially the type of thinking that happens when people write code.</p>
          <p>When I was in college at Wesleyan University, people called me "the server". As a freshman I had inherited a dubiously-legal cardboard box held together with beer wrappers that ran some homespun instances of dc++, bang with friends, and an anonymous confession board. It was clearly the beginning of something beautiful.</p>
          <p>Since those days of trolling campus network bandwidth, I've had a pretty varied experience. A former NYC teaching fellow, I've lingered somewhere on the vast spectrum formed by the intersection of education and technology; along the way, i taught myself to be a web developer.</p>
          <p>nowadays i evangelize open source, and actively work on transparent government and civic technology initiatives through my role as dev captain and co-organize of the NYC Code for America brigade, #betaNYC. for fun i'm a member of a band called CSV soundsystem that makes music with open data, and regularly cause trouble in the "philosophy in the time of software" google group. also i really like jokes.</p>

          <p>I initially connected to the internet on my Dad's <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_6200" target="_blank">Power Macintosh 6200</a> and was instantly hooked on the different ways I could waste time online. Slowly over time I got bored with consuming, and started teaching myself how to create. </p>
          <p>While at college at Carnegie Mellon University I started helping others create by being a Teacher's Assistant for 3 of my 4 years there. By senior year, I helped create an iPhone app for the Pittsburgh Post Gazette that crowdsourced public bus data and went on to work with faculty to develop an iOS class to be taught at CMU. After a brief stint at IBM, I've returned to what I really love and am looking forward to teaching and learning from you.</p>

          <h3>Jonathan Grover</h3>
          <h4>Instructor</h4>
          <p>With a deep interest in the fine arts and design I studied visual communication and received a BFA in graphic design in 2004. After college, hopping between freelance positions and in-house design teams my focus began to shift from print to the web. After teaching myself HTML and CSS, I hungered to learn more and began to delve into the programming languages: JavaScript and PHP. I began to see the greater possibilities of code as an expressive medium. The emergence of new media arts inspired me to further my studies. In 2009 I attended graduate school at San Francisco Art Institute to achieve an MFA in design and technology. Here I was introduced to building custom hardware, sensor networks, and open source software libraries: Arduino (C++), Pure Data, and Max/MSP.</p>
          <p>Mentored by sound artist Laetitia Sonami from 2007 - 2009 I began to build and exhibit interactive sculptures that generate sound and light in response to body movement and presence. I received media attention for my work from the San Francisco Chronicle, Creative Quarterly, NBC BayArea, and exhibited at San Jose Zero One and The Seattle Worlds Fair among other venues.</p> 
          <p>It was not long after that I discovered my love of teaching. I have since held instructing positions at San Francisco Art Institute (ACE Program), Pittsburgh Art Institute Online, and alternative learning spaces: 3rd Ward and Skillshare. I have logged over a thousand hours in the classroom reaching thousands of satisfied students.</p>
          <p>Having found my home at The Flatiron School--I look forward to growing my knowledge and helping others achieve their code dreams.</p>

          <p>After spending four freezing year in New Hampshire for college, I took to Hawaii where I was determined to learn 1) how to surf and 2) how to live the good life. After realizing I wasn't satisfied in paradise, I took the red pill and moved to NYC. I spent a few years building complicated Excel applications for hedge funds, traveled the world, and eventually found my calling: worshipping at the church of DHH.</p>
          <p>I spent a summer locked in my apartment working with a few friends to build my first Rails app, and then learned that Ruby and Rails were different things. I took a job as a Junior Developer at <a href="http://nyc.lifebooker.com/welcome" target="_blank">Lifebooker.com</a> and learned enormous amount, but wanted to get even closer to the metal. I left Lifebooker to learn and teach at Hacker School, and spent three months studying concurrency, learning C, and polishing my Javascript chops. I joined Flatiron School in March of 2013.</p>
          <p>If I'm not coding, you'll probably find me shredding waves on a beach somewhere tropical. But I always come back really missing SublimeText.</p>

          <h3>Jeffrey Baird</h3>
          <h4>Instructor</h4>
          <p>Most of my post-high school education was focused on becoming a merchant mariner. When I decided that a pirate's life was <strong>not</strong> for me, I started a tech company in Tampa, FL called Kngroo. While developing the company, I started picking up a little Ruby. It wasn't long before I was completely obsessed.</p>
          <p>I shut down Kngroo shortly after and started teaching myself to code full-time. A little over a year ago, I got my first Ruby gig working for Medivo, a start-up in Manhattan. Not long after that, Avi asked me to come help students replicate my success.</p>
         <p>When I'm not "hitting the keys," I bike, run, read and travel. I am a karaoke fiend and a coffee enthusiast. If you need to pick my brain about anything, I find it hard to say no to a good IPA.</p>
