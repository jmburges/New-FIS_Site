    <h2>iOS Student Curriculum</h2>
    <h3>Take your dev skills mobile.</h3>

<h1>The Basics //</h1>
<hr>
<p>The iOS course is an 10 week, full time, intensive program, designed to turn 
somebody with basic development skills into the equivalent skillset and experience of and
entry-level iOS Objective-C developer. This course is designed to enhance a 
students existing development skills by introducing them to a new environment,
not introduce them to development itself. Just like the Ruby class, you are 
required to be on campus Monday thru Friday, 9AM-6PM throughout the duration of 
the program. Outside of class there is plenty of work to be done, but that's the 
minimum.</p>

<p>The cost for the semester is 
$9,000. Grants and scholarships are also available for students from underrepresented groups
like women and minorities.</p>

<br/>

<h1>The Structure //</h1>

<h3>Prework: Fundamentals</h3>

<p>Before arriving on campus all students complete 20+ hours of prework.
During this phase we go for breadth over depth. The goal is to familiarize you 
with some basic concepts and get everyone to a minimum baseline so that we can 
hit the ground running on campus.</p>

<h3>Here’s what we look for in future iOS developers:  </h3>

Besides the same standards we set for all of our students, we are looking for 
future iOS developers who are currently familiar with any sort of 
development. What do we define as <em>familiar</em>? If asked to develop a very
simple twitter or facebook clone, you should be confident in your ability to 
complete the task. Also you should be comfortable enough with these coding 
concepts to get at least an 80% on the linked quizzes.
